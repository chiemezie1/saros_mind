To run the application locally, you'll need Node.js 18 or higher and npm installed on your system. Begin by cloning the repository and installing the required dependencies:- **⏰ Time Intensive**: Manual monitoring and analysis consuming hours of valuable time### **Meaningful DLMM SDK Integration**

## Architecture and Design Decisions



The platform follows a modular architecture that separates concerns between data fetching, calculation logic, and presentation layers. This design allows for easy extension and modification while maintaining code quality and performance. The use of TypeScript throughout the codebase provides type safety and improved developer experience.

```bash- ✅ **@saros-finance/dlmm-sdk** - Core analytics and position management

The decision to integrate directly with the Saros DLMM SDK ensures data accuracy and reduces the complexity of blockchain interactions. The platform prioritizes real-time data over cached information to provide users with the most current view of their positions, though intelligent caching is used where appropriate to optimize performance.

git clone https://github.com/chiemezie1/saros_mind.git

The user interface design emphasizes clarity and usability, with complex financial data presented in digestible formats. The responsive design ensures full functionality across desktop and mobile devices, recognizing that users may need to monitor their positions while away from their primary workstation.

cd saros_mind### **The Cost of Inefficiency:**- ✅ **Real-time Data Fetching** - Live pool metrics and portfolio updates

## Key Benefits for Liquidity Providers

npm install

Liquidity providers using this platform can expect significant improvements in their position management efficiency and overall returns. The comprehensive analytics help identify underperforming positions and optimization opportunities that might otherwise go unnoticed. Real-time monitoring capabilities allow for timely adjustments to changing market conditions, while historical analysis provides insights for developing better liquidity provision strategies.

```- Average LP loses **30-40%** potential returns due to poor position management- ✅ **Advanced Analytics Engine** - Sophisticated LP strategy algorithms

The platform reduces the time and complexity involved in managing DLMM positions by automating calculations and presenting data in easily understood formats. This allows liquidity providers to focus on strategic decisions rather than spending time on manual analysis and data gathering.



Risk management features help prevent significant losses by providing early warning indicators and comprehensive exposure analysis. The ability to monitor impermanent loss in real-time enables more informed decisions about position adjustments and exit strategies.

Create an environment configuration file with your RPC endpoint:- **60%** of LPs abandon positions due to complexity and lack of insights- ✅ **Production-Ready Architecture** - Scalable, maintainable codebase

## Real-World Applications



Individual liquidity providers can use the platform to optimize their personal portfolios, track performance across multiple positions, and make data-driven decisions about their liquidity provision strategies. The educational aspects of the platform help users understand DLMM mechanics and improve their overall DeFi knowledge.

```bash- Impermanent loss often goes unnoticed until it's too late
