## 💻 Development Guide

### Code Organization
The project follows a clean architecture pattern:

1. **Presentation Layer** (`src/app/`, `src/components/`)
   - Next.js pages and React components
   - User interface and interaction handling

2. **API Layer** (`src/app/api/`)
   - RESTful endpoints for data access
   - Request validation and response formatting

3. **Business Logic** (`src/lib/dlmm.ts`)
   - Core application logic and calculations
   - Integration with external services

4. **Integration Layer** (`src/lib/dlmm.ts` SDK calls)
   - Saros DLMM SDK integration
   - Blockchain data retrieval and processing

### Adding New Features

1. **Define Types** in `src/lib/types.ts`
2. **Implement Business Logic** in `src/lib/dlmm.ts`
3. **Create API Endpoint** in `src/app/api/`
4. **Build UI Components** in `src/components/`
5. **Update Dashboard** in `src/components/dlmm-dashboard.tsx`

### Testing Strategy
```bash
# Run type checking
npm run type-check

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Format code
npm run format

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## 🚀 Deployment
